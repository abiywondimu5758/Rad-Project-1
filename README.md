A WordPress theme is a group of files (graphics, style sheets, and code) that dictates the overall appearance of your blog or website. Themes can control something as vast as your site’s layout, or as minute as your hyperlink colors. It’s easy to think of a theme as a ‘skin’ for your site, but they are much more powerful than that.

Rather than simply providing a look and feel for your blog, a theme enables you to control the presentation of your site. For example, let’s say you blog about food, but you also have an online store. The right theme can display your blog posts in a certain way while offering a completely different layout for your store’s pages.

Themes are an inherent part of WordPress. In fact, the platform includes a number of themes out of the box. However, there are a few reasons why you may want to choose and install a fresh theme on your site:

To improve your site’s visual appeal. If you have a specific vision for your site, you can choose a suitable theme and customize it to meet your requirements. To enable more design customization. If you have no design or coding experience, many themes offer a wealth of customizations to help you create the right design. To implement additional functionality. Depending on your needs, a theme may include functionality related to your niche that can’t be found elsewhere.

While the default or a customized version of a theme can work for plenty of websites, there are actually thousands of themes available to choose from, covering specific niches and purposes.
